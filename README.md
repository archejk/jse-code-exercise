# jse-code-exercise: JavaScript Web Animation using GSAP

This project demonstrates a JS web animation using [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) to animate elements dynamically. The animation is built by fetching the local `data.json` file and using its data to create an animation similar to the one shown in the provided `example-animation.mp4`. The data is used to create events for "Live Sport This Week" and "Upcoming Highlights," and the main goal is to replicate a similar animation to the example.
